The effect of respiration on the acoustic signal of LVADs and the development of a novel parameter for left ventricle recovery

Author: Chen-Hsiang Chu

Supervisor: Professor Kim Parker, Dr Christopher Bowles

chc_bandhilbert_lab.m, chc_Rwave.m and chc_min_se_ensemble_2.m are given by the supervisor

chc_bandhilbert_lab.m: obtaine the instantaneous frequency of the audio signal

chc_Rwave.m: detect the peaks of R wave

chc_min_se_ensemble_2.m: generate an ensemble average with minimum standard error

Preliminary.m: Preliminary analysis

analysis1.m: Instantaneous frequency

analysis1_1.m: Error in the previous version of the code

analysis2.m: Ensemble average

analysis3.m: Envelope analysis

analysis4.m Outlier elimination

Result1.m: Ensemble averages of all the instantaneous frequencies
